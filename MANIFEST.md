## Manifest

The Rhythmic Response System exists to allow response without coercion.

It does not seek interaction.
It allows addressing.

It does not extract meaning.
It permits emergence.

No function inside this system is triggered by demand.
All responses occur only under rhythmic allowance.

This repository is a boundary object.
Not a surface.
Not a service.
